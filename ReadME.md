  ## Description
  Challenge 10 from the University of Minnesota Fullstack Coding Bootcamp. 

  This application prompts the user to select the text, shape, and color for their logo. It then creates a SVG file for the logo using the user input. 

  Project 10 focuses on Object Oriented Programming and testing. This project uses Test Driven Development and Unit Testing to create the tests and code. Through this project I've learned the importance of Test Drive Development and how without TDD, it can be easy to overlook edge cases while programming.

  ## Installation
  This application does use Node.JS so the user will have to install Node.JS to use it. Once Node.JS is installed the user can type the command "NPM install" to get all the necessary dependencies for this application.
  
  ## Usage
  Since this application uses Node.JS the user can type "Node index.js" into the command line to run the application. The user will be prompted to answer a few questions and then a svg file will be created for the logo they selected. 


  ## Tests
  This application uses Jest and follows Test Driven Development for Unit Testing. The file svgGenerator.test.js test that the user input is acceptable and if not that an error message is returned. It also test that the render function which returns the data used in the svg file, is returning the correct information regardless of the class that calls it. 

  ## Technologies Used
  Node.JS, NPM, Inquirer, Jest and FS File System were used to create this application.
